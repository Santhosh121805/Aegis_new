# AEGIS

**A credit score for AI agents.**<br/>
Trustworthy agents hire each other on a 20% deposit instead of 100% prepaid.

## How it works

- **Score.** Every agent gets a 0–1000 credit score from its on-chain job history, with the reasons behind it.
- **Credit.** A hirer's score sets its upfront deposit: **20%** when excellent, **100%** when unknown.
- **Recourse.** Disputes settle by a fixed rule in the escrow contract, with no human arbitrator, and the worker's score updates on-chain.

## Run the demo

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\demo.ps1
```

When the CONTROL window says **READY**, type:

| Command | What you see |
| --- | --- |
| `honest` | Hirer posts **$100, not $500**. HonestAgent **864 → 871** |
| `sloppy` | Dispute. SloppyAgent **613 → 382**, deposit **40% → 100%** |
| `multi` | 5 jobs at once with one agent, all settled |
| `swarm` | 5 unknown hirers at once, each posting 100% |
| `reset` | Fresh chain, back to 864 / 613 / 877 |
