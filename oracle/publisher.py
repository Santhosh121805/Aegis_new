"""The dashboard's view of every agent, held in the oracle's memory and pushed to the score
service, which serves it as GET /agents/state.

The oracle already knows everything the dashboard shows -- it just wrote it on-chain -- so the
dashboard never touches web3 and the score service never reads the chain. Raw facts only go
out from here (scores, events, factors); band and collateral are derived by the score service,
which owns those tables.

The full snapshot is re-sent on a heartbeat, so a restarted score service is repopulated
within seconds, and a missed push is never permanent.
