"""STAND-IN HIRER. Drives one job end to end. It is a script, not a real hiring
agent.

    post job -> wait for delivery -> judge it -> accept or dispute -> settle -> show rescore

The judgement is a stand-in too: a delivery that lands less than MIN_WORK_SECONDS after the
job was created (by block time) is treated as "no work was done" and disputed. HonestAgent
works for ~3s; SloppyAgent delivers at once.

Works against either escrow, following deployments/local.json "escrowIsStub":
  - real AegisEscrow: real mUSDC moves. The hirer approves the FULL job value up front,
    because the escrow takes the collateral at createJob and the remainder at settle.
    Approving only the collateral does not fail -- settle succeeds, pays the worker the
    collateral, and records the HIRER as defaulted. So after every settle this script checks
    the hirer was not recorded as a default, and exits loudly if it was.
  - StubEscrow: no tokens exist; balances are not shown.

Usage (from the repo root; anvil, deploy, score service, oracle and the agent running):
    agents/.venv/Scripts/python agents/demo_driver.py --worker HonestAgent
    agents/.venv/Scripts/python agents/demo_driver.py --worker SloppyAgent --value 500
