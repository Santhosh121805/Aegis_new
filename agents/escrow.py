"""The one place the agents learn which escrow they are talking to.

==========================================================================================
 REAL ESCROW PLUGS IN HERE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Agents speak only the IAegisEscrow interface (SPEC.md section 6): createJob,
 markDelivered, accept, dispute, settle and the JobCreated / JobDelivered / JobDisputed /
 JobSettled events. They never see StubEscrow's own ABI.

 deployments/local.json["AegisEscrow"] is Teammate A's real AegisEscrow after a deploy, or
 StubEscrow after `select_escrow.py --stub`; "escrowIsStub" says which. The agents need no
 change either way. The one escrow-specific step, approving mUSDC before createJob, lives
 in demo_driver.py because only the hirer moves tokens.
